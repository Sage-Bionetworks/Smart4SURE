    // TODO: syoung 07/19/2016 Data refresh doesn't work with UI Testing and KIF breaks with every change of the
    // OS. Instead, adding only this one test to set the externalId to a test account with "training_user"
    // as the only data group. This will facilitate manual testing with a known account. For now, that's the best
    // that I can find that will work consistently. Work-arounds are all brittle and do not work consistently.
